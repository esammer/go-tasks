# Go Tasks

Package go_tasks is a small, zero dependency, library that provides a production-ready implementation of common
concurrent task management patterns. It's suitable for implementing fine-grained worker pools. It's meant to make task
implementations easily testable without adding a ton of framework or concurrency infrastructure.

See the Go docs for more information.
